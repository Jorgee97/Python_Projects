# Python Projects
This is a repository that I will use to commit, my python little projects, and scripts.

Here is a little list of what is on this repository, there are some HackerRank problems, and some little games like hangman or roll a dice.

Some of this scripts are not written by me, I just use them for learning purposes.

## WebsiteGenerator
This project is a little test of the Click library for create command line tools, this one just create the next structure:

```
- Folder_Name
   -- jss
   -- css
   index.html
```

## Takenotes (On progress)
This project is not completed yet, by now it only works on local, I've only tested on linux enviroment, windows is pending to test.

This project is a command line tool that allow you to take notes from your terminal, and it save those notes to a txt file on the location you choose, also you can list the notes on the console.

commands available are: 
   ```
   takeNotes.py setup SAVE_DIRECTORY
   takeNotes.py note NOTE
   takeNotes.py list
   ```
you can get detailed information by calling --help on any of those three commands (setup, note, list).
